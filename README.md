Includes a public website and an admin panel for managing clubs, events, and homepage sliders.
Built with Spring Boot 3, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, JWT-based authentication, and Bean Validation.

[lmsJava](https://github.com/aliyev-nijat)  - A command-line Learning Management System (LMS) using MySQL to manage students, teachers, groups, attendance, and grades. Supports creating multiple teachers and groups with full record tracking. Built through self-study, so the code may not fully follow clean code principles.
